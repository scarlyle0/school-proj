# Programming Assignment 5

This program takes a simulated deck of cards and simulates what shuffling

a hand of this deck would be like. It does this from 1-n with n being the

number of cards in the deck. It then keeps on shuffling each hand until

it shuffles back into its original ordered list. Then it displays the order,

or how many times it had to be shuffled to get back to the original hand.
